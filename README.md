# Repository for tasks and examples for object orientation and design patterns in Python

## Introduction

This repository stores some examples and tasks for Object Oriented Programming and design patterns in Python 
It is starting as gathering of my own thoughts on the subject but is written with a purpose to be a collection of practical resources on the topic.
If it is limited to my own use, that is still not bad ;)

## Deployment

Run it the same as any pythod code you run
It there are any dependencies they should be mentioned in specific projects
